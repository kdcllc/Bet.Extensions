Setup AAD Pod Identity Configuration in AKS

# AAD Pod Identity Project

[AAD Pod Identity](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity) enables Kubernetes applications to access cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory (AAD).

Using Kubernetes primitives, administrators configure identities and bindings to match pods. Then without any code modifications, your containerized applications can leverage any resource in the cloud that depends on AAD as an identity provider.
