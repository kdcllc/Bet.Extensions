> The second letter in the Hebrew alphabet is the ×‘ bet/beit. Its meaning is "house". In the ancient pictographic Hebrew it was a symbol resembling a tent on a landscape.

_Note: Pre-release packages are distributed via [feedz.io](https://f.feedz.io/kdcllc/bet-extensions/nuget/index.json)._

This goal of this repo is to provide with a reusable functionality for developing Microservices with Docker and Kubernetes.
These libraries extend `Microsoft.Extensions` and `Microsoft.Extensions` namespaces accordingly.
